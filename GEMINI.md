Act as an expert web designer, UI/UX designer, and senior frontend developer. 
Create pixel-perfect responsive HTML + CSS code that visually matches the following UI exactly:

================= PAGE DESCRIPTION =================

This is a landing page similar to Canva’s homepage. The design must match the layout, text, font style, gradients, spacing, button styling, and colors accurately.

================= BACKGROUND & LAYOUT =================

• The page has a full-width, full-height background gradient.
• Gradient colors are **top → bottom**:
   - Top: #A53DFF (violet / purple tone)
   - Middle: #4C7CFF (blue tone)
   - Bottom: #0CC0A1 (teal/aqua tone)
• The gradient transition is very smooth and covers the entire viewport.

• Content is centered horizontally with generous top margin padding (around 90–110px from top).

• Font family must look similar to Canva’s: Use **'Poppins', 'Inter', or sans-serif** with smooth letter spacing.

================= HEADER / NAVBAR =================

• Positioned at the top horizontally, full width, transparent bg.
• Left side: White Canva-styled logo text (italic handwriting script style).
• Right side navigation links spaced evenly with approx. 30–35px gap:
   - "Design"
   - "Product"
   - "Plans"
   - "Business"
   - "Education"
   - "Help"
• All nav items are **white**, medium weight, no underline, cursor pointer.
• On the far right, two buttons:
    1. **Sign up** button:
         - Background color: #B884F5 (light purple)
         - Text: White, medium font-weight
         - Slight border radius (8–12px)
         - Padding approx. 8px 18px
    2. **Log in** button:
         - Background: White (#FFFFFF)
         - Text: #6B6B6B (grayish tone)
         - Border radius: 8–12px
         - Padding approx. 8px 18px
• Both buttons must be aligned vertically centered with nav items.

================= MAIN HEADING =================

• Large hero headline centered on page:
   Line #1: **A new era**
   Line #2: **of imagination**
• Font size approx. 80–100px large, bold, smooth, white text.
• Line-height balanced and centered, no shadow.

================= SUB-HEADING TAGLINE =================

• One short centered paragraph under the main heading:
  “Discover a whole new world of skills and tools designed to put your imagination to work.”

• Text is light white (#FFFFFF) with slight opacity (0.85).
• Font size approx. 20–24px, max-width 700–850px, centered, balanced line height.

================= BUTTONS SECTION =================

Placed directly under tagline, centered horizontally, approx. 40px spacing from text.

Two buttons side-by-side with 18–24px spacing:

================= RESPONSIVENESS =================

• Headings scale down proportionally.
• Navbar collapses into centered stacked items or mobile menu.

✔ Full HTML structure
